- ~~Remove total from switch transfer direction.~~
- ~~Check that the useEffect in SimProvider works on load~~

1) move to tailwindcss
2) Optimize events before start time
3) 'New' button with automatic date ranges (based on today)
4) Think about types and data layout.  What will make the most sense for creating an svg graph from scratch?
